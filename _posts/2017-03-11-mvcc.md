## MVCC of PostgreSQL
=====================
* A snapshot is recorded at the start of each SQL statement in READ COMMITTED transaction isolation mode, and at transaction start in SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation mode. In fact, it is frequency of taking new snapshots that controls the transaction isolation behavior.
* Useful UDFs to inspect snapshot:
	* `txid_current()`
	* `txid_current_snapshot()`
	* select xmin, xmax, cmin, cmax from tbl;
* Aborted IDs Can Remain in tuple header because Transaction Status Is Recorded Centrally (in pg_clog)
* For select for update statement, xmax can be used to achieve row locking, as long as we mark the tuple bit `HEAP_XMAX_EXCL_LOCK` to indicate that xmax is a locking xid rather than an expiration xid.
* Multi-statement transactions require extra tracking because each statement has its own visibility rules. For example, **a cursorâ€™s contents must remain unchanged even if later statements in the same transaction modify rows**. Such tracking is implemented using system command id columns cmin/cmax.
* Because cmin and cmax are internally a single system column, it is impossible to simply record the status of a row that is created and expired in the same multi-statement transaction. For that reason, a special **combo command id** is created that references a **local memory hash** that contains the actual cmin and cmax values.
* Vacuum involves recycling space taken by several entities:
	* heap tuples/rows (the largest)	* heap item pointers (the smallest)
	* index entries
* Indexes point to ItemPointers, not tuples, so Vacuum would first clean up tuples, and mark the item pointers of the cleaned tuples as 'dead', then perform index clean up, and mark the 'dead' item pointers as 'unused'
