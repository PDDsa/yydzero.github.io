* A **total order** is a binary relation that defines an order for every element in some set.
* Two distinct elements are comparable when one of them is greater than the other. In a **partially ordered** set, some pairs of elements are not comparable and hence a partial order doesn't specify the exact order of every item.
* Both total order and partial order are transitive and antisymmetric.
