==> Dynamic instrumentation often includes:
	--> binary structural analysis, to find potential instrumentation point;
	--> ptrace mechanism to send a SIGTRAP(?) to the target process to stop the
	it, and then modify the instructions of it, for example change it to int
	0x03 in x86 arch, or a branch-always instruction to jump to a trampoline;

==> gdb and strace are implemented using ptrace, ptrace is closely coupled with kernel
	support, see man 2 ptrace; ptrace uses signal to stop a process initially
	when attaching;
