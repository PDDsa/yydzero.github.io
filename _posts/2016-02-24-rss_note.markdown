==> ERROR: JOIN qualification may not refer to other relations
	A "mutator" is always supposed to create a deep copy of the tree, this is a
	assumption in PostgreSQL; flat copy(FLATCOPY()) means memcpy the node, deep
	copy(copyObject) means recurse into each sub-structure and copy the fields;

==> ExecutorEnd gets run twice, which is not good
	If QD hits an ERROR, and is aborting current transaction, then if there
	comes a SIGINT, ExecutorEnd may be called twice, which would lead to
	assertion failure;

	Heikki's idea seems to be avoiding calling ExecutorEnd when aborting, and
	instead divide the functionality of ExecutorEnd to ResourceOwners and
	MemoryContexts, such as Gang releasion and interconnect tearing down;
