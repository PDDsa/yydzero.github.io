==> LOCALLOCK is mainly for recording the number of times the lock has been
	acquired, since a process/transaction would be counted only once in share
	memory lock; the numbers are tracked per ResourceOwner;
	Main fields:
	--> LOCALLOCKTAG tag: combination of LOCKTAG and lockmode;
	--> LOCK *lock: corresponding lock in share memory; LOCALLOCK in process
		private, so we can use pointer directly;
	--> PROCLOCK *proclock: corresponding proclock in share memory;
	--> int64 nLocks; number of times acquired;

==> LOCK, PROCLOCK, and LOCALLOCK are organized into hash table
	LockMethodLockHash, LockMethodProcLockHash and LockMethodLocalHash in share
	memory;
