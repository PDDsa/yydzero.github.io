==> Using script in gdb is super powerful in some situations; Normally, we write
	script in a file, and source this file in gdb, then we can use the functions
	defined in the script; the syntax of the script is quite like python;

==> To redirect the output of the gdb command to files, first, set logging file
	to the destination file, then set logging on;
