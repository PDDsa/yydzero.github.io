### initTM and FTS:
* InitPostgres would call cdb_setup for each process forked, cdb_setup would first InitMotionLayerIPC for all backends except the utility mode, and then call initTM for QD; in initTM, if the backend is the first QD backend forked, then recoverTM would be called, which would connect to all segments to check whether there are any in doubt transations need to be recovered.
* BUG: in recoverTM, if Gp_role == GP_ROLE_UTILITY and FTS is in read only mode, then shmDtmRecoveryDeferred would be set false, while the recovery would not be done.
* recoverTM:
	1. verifyFtsSyncCount: check if local fts status is up to date with fts prober;
	2. check if FTS is in read only mode, if yes, defer recovery; if not, call recoverInDoubtTransactions to do the recovery;
	3. set shmGIDSeq, which is the next global transation id to be allocated;
	4, set the DTM status(shmDtmStarted) to be started;
* recoverInDoubtTransactions:
	1. ReplayRedoFromUtilityMode() to check master log to find all the transactions which are commited but not forget committed;
	2. For each in-doubt dtx found in master log, call doNotifyCommittedInDoubt to dispatch Commit Prepared to all segments(via cdbdisp_dispatchDtxProtocolCommand)
	3. insert a Forget Committed in master log;
	4. call gatherRMInDoubtTransactions() to collect all in-doubt transations on segments, via cdbdisp_dispatchRMCommand("select * from pg_prepared_xacts");
	5. abortRMInDoubtTransactions, which is going to abort the found in-doubt transactions on segments, would first pick the master spotted in-doubt transactions first, and then doAbortInDoubt(via cdbdisp_dispatchDtxProtocolCommand) for the left;
	6. doublt check by gatherRMInDoubtTransactions(), if there is still in-doubt transactions on segments, ereport error to let dba manually recover.
	7. RemoveRedoUtilityModeFile
* initTM:
	1. initTM is called in a context where no upper try/catch exists, so there is a try/catch block to encapsulate recoverTM, and if error occurs, it would be written into log and then FlushErrorState() is called;
	2. initTM has a retry mechanism for recoverTM, but would only retry once; in the retry code path, detectFailedConnection would be called(now ftsNotifyProber) to update gp_segment_configuration; if recoverTM succeeds, gangs would be released; otherwise, ereport FATAL;
	3. in summary, initTM is used to recover in-doubt transations after cluster restart;
* NB: MPP-9894 has resolved issue in MPP-5764, so we can remove the DTM check in FtsHandleGangConnectionFailure now I think.
* FTS would update catalog and shmem when change detected, including gp_segment_configuration, gp_configuration_history, and ftsProbeInfo->fts_status in shmem;
* FtsTestSegmentDBIsDown would return true if segments response the socket, that is to say, postmaster is up;
