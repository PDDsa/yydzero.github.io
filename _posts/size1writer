1, one session can only have one writer on each segment, thus when introducing
1-size writer, we have to gurantee the primary writer has been destroyed; (we
can see whether GPDB would crash if we do not destroy the primary writer gang)

2, when plan has several slices, each slice must has the same content id if we
want to allocate 1-size writer gang.
