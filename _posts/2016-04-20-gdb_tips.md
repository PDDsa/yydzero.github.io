* Using script in gdb is super powerful in some situations; Normally, we write script in a file, and source this file in gdb, then we can use the functions defined in the script; the syntax of the script is quite like python; example is like:

```
define pmc1
    set $context = (MemoryContext) $arg0
    printf "%s: %ld bytes\n", $context->name, ($context->allBytesAlloc - $context->allBytesFreed)
end
document pmc1
    print MemoryContext name and used bytes.
    Usage: pmc1 memCtx
end

define pmc
    if ($arg0 != 0)
        set $bytes = (((MemoryContext)$arg0)->allBytesAlloc - ((MemoryContext)$arg0)->allBytesFreed)
        if $bytes != 0
            printf "%s: %ld bytes\n", ((MemoryContext)$arg0)->name, $bytes
        end

        pmc ((MemoryContext)$arg0)->nextchild
        pmc ((MemoryContext)$arg0)->firstchild
    end
end
document pmc
    print MemoryContext name and used bytes recursively.
    Usage: pmc memCtx
end
```

* To redirect the output of the gdb command to files, first, set logging file to the destination file, then set logging on;
* sometimes, for binary which is optimized in compilation stage, the signature of functions in the backtrace may be wrong; sometimes, the line which gdb says SIGSEGV happens may be wrong either, we can identify the crashed line by assembly code; to map a snippet of assembly code to source code, we can search some special constant variable in the assembly, like i++(1) etc; there is possibility that a single variable can have two different pointer in two adjacent frames, especially when it is an argument passed from lower frame, this is caused by the fact that argument is passed by register, and upper frame mov the value in register to stack, and then this register is modified later, so gdb would compute the argument to be a wrong value; normally, for this kind of cases, we can find the correct value in the lower frame.
