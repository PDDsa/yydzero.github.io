==> XXX should we remove gp\_is\_callback?
==> XXX why we need LWLockAcquire the partition LWLock again in ProcSleep?
==> XXX lockHolderProcPtr is set when trying to acquire a lock, can it guarantee
	the correctness? when it is called, does the PGPROC all ready? when
	dumpSnapshot is called, is lockHolderProcPtr already set?

	ProcArrayAdd/ProcArrayRemove
	when is the PGPROC put into procArray? is LockAcquire called before putting
	it in?

	ProcArrayAdd->InitProcessPhase2
