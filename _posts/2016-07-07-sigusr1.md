### SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2 in GPDB
* The SIGUSR1 signal is multiplexed to support signalling multiple event types. The specific reason is communicated via flags in shared memory. We keep a boolean flag for each possible "reason", so that different reasons can be signaled to a process concurrently. (However, if the same reason is signaled more than once nearly simultaneously, the process may observe it only once.)
* ProcSignalSlot struct is used to record signal flag in share memory, if process A wants to signal SIGUSR1 to process B with reason Catchup, then A finds ProcSignalSlot of B, and set the flag field to true; each process would have a static variable MyProcSignalSlot to refer to the its slot in share memory, and the wrapper to check the flag is CheckProcSignal. The function to send a sigusr1 to another process is SendProcSignal.
* Now, SIGUSR1 is used for Catchup event, QueryFinish event, and Notify event, Notify event is disabled in GPDB.
* handler of SIGUSR1 is registered to be procsignal_sigusr1_handler, procsignal_sigusr1_handler would triage the signal reason and call corresponding handlers; for Catchup event, the handler is HandleCatchupInterrupt, this function would check catchupInterruptEnabled before taking substantial actions.
